## Project Purpose and Components
As the first project of the class, project 1 simply required students to work with visual studio code and the command terminal on a basic level.

## What I Learned
This project really just served as a refresher on previous classes I'd taken in the minor (in terms of using visual studio), as well as an elaboration on the first two labs where I was learning about the command terminal for the first time.
